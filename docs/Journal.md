## Seperation of work and colleberation

**The design** was done in colaberation, collected around a (digital) white board. 
This meant that everbody was updated and informed about the dession, aswell as making sure everbodys ideas where heard. 

**The implementation** 
The resposiblity of implementation of the app and the implementation of the tests where sperated between group members, to achive higher black box testing. 

Futher more, the implementation of the tests should be the first thing tackled. 



## Using CI with Jinkins 

The Jenkins CI system was set up as the first thing, besides creating the empty projects. 
This meant that from the early development, writing testable code and its test where on the top of the minds of the developers. 
It also allowed the development to be tracked, with the additions of test, and their results.
